\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 It would be confusing to the user if 6 shows up in the cart indicator after clicking qty 6, because they might think they clicked add to cart multiple times. In addition, since this is food, it would probably come in the same bakery box, so i would be confusing if it was counted as individual quantities. \
