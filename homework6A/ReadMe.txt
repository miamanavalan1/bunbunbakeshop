New features on product details page: 
1) Users have to choose both a glazing option and qty option to add to cart 
2) When users select glazing & qty option, background color changes 
3) When user clicks add to cart â€” visual indicator on top right increments by 1. It would be confusing to the user if 6 shows up in the cart indicator after clicking qty 6, because they might think they clicked add to cart multiple times. In addition, since this is food, it would probably come in the same bakery box, so i would be confusing if it was counted as individual quantities. 

Cart page:
